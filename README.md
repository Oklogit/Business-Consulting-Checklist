    **BUSINESS CONSULTING CHECKLIST**

The goal of this project is to make it easy for clients to share their needs and details through simple checklists and a quick bio form that sends everything straight to the consulting firm’s email
The project includes three distinct checklists for a business consulting firm, each offering different options for clients to select from.
In addition, there is a short bio form to capture client information.
The form is integrated with a third-party SMTP service to automatically send client requests and details directly to the consulting firm’s email, enabling them to follow up accordingly
